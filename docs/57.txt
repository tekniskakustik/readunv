                      NDV*NPOS*NNODS Where NPOS Is Number Of Positions
                      Through Element And NNODS Is Number Of Nodes On
                      Element.  The Order Of Data Is NDV Values For
                      Position 1 Of Node 1,NDV Values For Position 2 Of
                      Node 1, . . . , NDV Values For Position 1 Of Node 2,
                      Etc.  The Order Of The Nodes Defines An Outward
                      Normal Which  Specifies The Order From Position 1 To
                      NPOS.
          9        Any Record With All 0.0's Data Entries Need Not (But
                      May) Appear.

                      Appear, All Data For The Data Set Is 0.0.
          11       When New Analysis Types Are Added, Record 7 Fields 1
                      And 2 Are Always > Or = 1 With Dummy Integer And
                      Real Zero Data If Data Is Not Required.  If Complex
                      Data Is Needed, It Is Treated As Two Real
                      Numbers,Real Part Followed By Imaginary Point.
          12       Dataloaders Use The Following ID Line Convention:
 
             a.      (80A1) Model Identification
             b.      (80A1) Run Identification
             c.      (80A1) Run Date/Time
 
             d.      (80A1) Load Case Name
 
                   For Static
 
                   e.   (17h Load Case Number; I10)
 
                   For Normal Mode

          13          Maximum Value For NDV Is 9
                      No Maximum Value For NVPN
