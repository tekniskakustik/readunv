          6        Typical Fortran I/O Statements For The Data Sections
                      Are:
 
                                  READ (LUN, 1000) NUM, NVAL
                                  WRITE
                      1000        FORMAT (2I10)
                          READ (LUN, 1010) (VAL(I),I=1,NVAL)
                                  WRITE
                      1010        FORMAT (6E13.5)
 
                      Where:      NUM   Is Element Number
                          NVAL Is Number Of Real Or Complex Data Values
                                      For This Element (Max = 90)
                          VAL    Is Real Or Complex Data Array
 
          7        Data Characteristic Values Imply The Following Values
                      Of Ndv:
 
                      Scalar: 1
 
                      3 DOF Global Vector: 3
                      6 DOF Global Vector: 6
                      Symmetric Global Tensor: 6
                      General Global Tensor: 9
          8        Data On 2d Type Elements May Have Multiple Values
                      Through The Element Thickness.  In These Cases,
                      NVAL = NDV*NPOS Where NPOS Is Number Of Positions
                      Through Element.  NPOS Is Always 1 For Solids.  The
                      Order Of The Data Is NDV Values For Position 1,  NDV
                      Values For Position 2, Etc.  The Order Of The Nodes
                      Defines An Outward Normal Which Specifies The Order
                      From Position 1 To NPOS.
 
          9        Any Record With All 0.0's Data Entries Need Not (But
                      May) Appear.
          10       A Direct Result Of 9 Is That If No Record 9 & 10
                      Appears, All Data For The Data Set Is 0.0.
          11       When New Analysis Types Are Added, Record 7 Fields 1
                      And 2 Are Always > Or = 1 With Dummy Interger And
                      Real Zero Data If Data Is Not Required.  If Complex
                      Data Is Needed, It Is Treated As Two Real Numbers,
                      Real Part Followed By Imaginary Point.
